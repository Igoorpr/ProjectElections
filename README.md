Software System for Managing the Upcoming Municipal Elections.

Developed in 2019 for an academic project, these files are contain JAVA code.

This project consists of a system composed of two main modules, aimed at managing and controlling the municipal elections. The system generates and handles .TXT files for the registration and control of electoral data.

1. The CONTROL_TRE module is responsible for the administration and registration of electoral and administrative data essential for the electoral process. Its main functionalities include:

- Registration of Political Parties
- Registration of Municipalities
- Registration of Candidates
- Registration of Voters
- Registration of Electronic Ballots
- Data export to the Electronic Ballots
- Vote counting after the election
- Close the Program

The main function of the Electronic Ballot module is to store the voters' votes. It organizes the votes based on the electoral section and municipality, using the files generated by CONTROL_TRE.

The ballot records the information of each vote, which will later be read and counted by the CONTROL_TRE module.

The data is stored in lists. When the user selects the "Close the program" option, the software generates the .TXT files containing all the final data, concluding the electoral process.
